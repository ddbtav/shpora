cron jobs - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

The software utility cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. People who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.[1] The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos).
